This guide assumes that you have deployed Gloo to the `gloo-system` namespace and that the `glooctl` command line utility
is installed on your machine. `glooctl` provides several convenient functions to view, manipulate, and debug Gloo resources;
in particular, it is worth mentioning the following command, which we will use each time we need to retrieve the URL of
the Gloo Gateway that is running inside your cluster:

```shell
glooctl proxy url
```
