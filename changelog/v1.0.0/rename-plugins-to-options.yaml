    description: |
      Rename all instances of `plugins` to `options` in Gloo's API. This prevents confusion as Gloo "plugins" is really an implementation detail for devs, and Gloo does not currently support dynamically-loaded plugins (aside from ExtAuth plugins).

      Proto messages have been updated as such:

      1. `VirtualHostPlugins` -> `VirtualHostOptions`
      2. `RoutePlugins` -> `RouteOptions`
      3. `WeightedDestinationPlugins` -> `WeightedDestinationOptions`
      4. `ListenerPlugins` -> `ListenerOptions`
      5. `HttpListenerPlugins` -> `HttpListenerOptions`
      6. `TcpListenerPlugins` -> `TcpListenerOptions`

      When referenced in yaml, each property is referenced as `options` under the appropriate containing resource.
