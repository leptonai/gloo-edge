  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1489
    description: >
      The Gateway controller can now optionally process Gateway CRDs from anywhere in the watch
      namespaces, not just the namespace where the controller is running. The new setting
      controlling that can be found in the Gloo Settings object, at
      `gateway.readGatewaysFromAllNamespaces`. The value of this field can be configured at install
      time by setting the new Helm field `gateway.readGatewaysFromAllNamespaces` to your desired
      value; it defaults to false to preserve the old behavior.

    description: >
      Add a Helm values field `gateway.readGatewaysFromAllNamespaces`. This new field defaults to false
      to preserve the old Gateway controller behavior, which is to read Gateway CRDs only from the
      namespace in which the controller is running. When the field is set to `true`, it will read Gateway
      CRDs from any of the watch namespaces.
