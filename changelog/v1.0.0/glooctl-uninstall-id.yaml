    description: >
      Use the installation ID set by Helm to ensure that glooctl uninstalls only resources created for
      the instance of Gloo being uninstalled. It does this by attempting to read the "installationId"
      label from the gloo pod. If the label is not found, the uninstall will fail. You can choose to
      proceed by passing the new --force flag to "glooctl uninstall", which will attempt to perform an
      uninstall that may inadvertently delete cluster-scoped resources belonging to some other
      installation of Gloo.
