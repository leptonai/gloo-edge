  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >
      When a Gateway has an empty httpGateway.virtualServices ref list, include all virtual services
      in the same namespace as the gateway. Previously the behavior was to include all virtual services
      in the cluster, which is unfriendly to multi-tenant setups.
