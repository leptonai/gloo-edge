  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >
      Update ExtAuth secret API to use strongly-typed configuration. OAuth and ApiKey secrets are no longer
      configured in the opaque `extensions` block, the same configuration lives at the top level in the `api_key` and
      `oauth` blocks.

    description: |
      Undeprecate `Extension`s (as configured on Gloo resources such as `Listener`s, `VirtualHost`s, `Route`s, etc.) and update documentation to explain its new purpose.

      Extensions are now used for:

      * controllers, deployment pipelines, helm charts, etc. which wish to use extensions as a kind of opaque metadata. Extensions will be passed along from Gateways, VirtualServices, and Route tables to the underlying Proxy, making them useful for controllers, validation tools, etc. which interact with kubernetes yaml.
      * gRPC-based plugins which communicate with the Gloo translator out-of-process. Having extensions available enables development of out-of-process plugins without requiring recompiling & redeploying Gloo's API
