changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1650
  description: >
    Adds the glooctl command "glooctl debug yaml". This command dumps a YAML manifest representing the current
    state of the Gloo installation running in the specified namespace. This is mainly used as a debug tool,
    and is not yet suitable for use as a Gloo backup tool; the dumped manifest contains resourceVersions,
    so you may be unable to do, for example, "glooctl debug yaml | kubectl apply -f -" if a resource has changed
    between the dump and the "kubectl apply".
