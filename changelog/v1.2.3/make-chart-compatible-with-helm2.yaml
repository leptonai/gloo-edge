  description: >
    The recent `v1.2.0` release updated the Gloo chart to be compatible with Helm 3. This included moving the CRDs
    to the new dedicated `/crd` directory inside the chart. Helm 2 is not aware of this directory and hence will
    never render the CRDs. This fix adds back a CRD template file in the `templates` directory to make the chart
    backwards-compatible with Helm 2.

  description: >
    We currently allow setting the `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` attribute on the `certgen` job via the
    `gateway.certGenJob.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` Helm value. Since this attribute was introduced with kubernetes 1.12,
    we here introduce a check in the Helm template to not render it if the version of kubernetes is less than 1.12.
