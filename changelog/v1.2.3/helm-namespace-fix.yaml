  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Ensure that our usage of the Helm client libraries assigns a namespace to all resources, even those
      whose YAML definition does not specify a namespace. This is to fix the bug where observability resources
      can wind up in the default namespace set by the user's kube config; as of the time of writing, Prometheus's
      chart defines resources that are namespaced but do not have a namespace explicitly set on them.
