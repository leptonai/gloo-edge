- type: NON_USER_FACING
  description: >
    Re-order the messages in the security-related proto files so that higher-level messages appear at the top of the file.
    this will improve the experience of navigating to the protos. We currently link mostly to the messages that represent
    VirtualHost/Route options, which often are at the bottom of the proto files. This causes the browser to seemingly focus
    on unrelated messages when navigating to such messages.
