    description: >
      Update install script to honor `GLOO_VERSION` env var for desired version, if set. Also update to sort located
      releases in semver order so that if desired version is omitted, we try to download the largest release rather
      than the most recent release. (for example, we backport a fix and release a 0.x.x after 1.0.0 is already out).
