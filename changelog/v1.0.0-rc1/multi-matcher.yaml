changelog:
  - type: BREAKING_CHANGE
    description: >
      Add support for multiple matchers on a Gateway/Gloo Route to reduce user duplication in yaml/user code. Also
      allows users to omit matchers on routes (the `/` prefix matcher will be used) to allow all requests to match the
      route.
