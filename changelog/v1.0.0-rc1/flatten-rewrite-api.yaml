    description: >
      Flatten prefix rewrite and host rewrite APIs. Move `auto_host_rewrite` from static upstream to route plugins since
      it's a route-level Envoy config; this fixes confusing behavior where a single static upstream on a route sets
      `auto_host_rewrite` for the entire route.
