changelog:
  - type: HELM
    description: >
      Add a helm chart value `gatewayProxies.$gatewayProxy.gatewaySettings.ipv4Only`.
      This changes the Gateway spec's bindAddress to '0.0.0.0' instead of '::',
      which is ipv6 by default. Use this helm value if your network allows ipv4 addresses only.
