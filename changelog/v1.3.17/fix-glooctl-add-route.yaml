    description: >
      In `glooctl` 1.3.16, there was a regression with the `glooctl add route` command that prevented it from working
      if the `--name` flag was omitted, which was common in our documented tutorials. Pre 1.3.16, `glooctl add route`
      would search all namespaces for a virtual service with * for domain (all domains) to add the route to. This
      would require cluster-scoped permissions on the virtual service by the user.

      This change defaults `glooctl add route` to use a namespaced virtual service client, which requires fewer
      permissions, but also only searches a single namespace for virtual services to add the route to, before creating
      a new virtual service. `glooctl add route` now supports the `cluster-scoped-vs-client` boolean flag, which
      supports the original, pre 1.3.16 behavior.
