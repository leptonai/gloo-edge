  description: >
    When the translation of the Gloo API snapshot to the xDS one returns an error we currently skip updating the xDS cache.
    Gloo attempts to remove errored upstreams without compromising the consistency of the snapshot, but most errors still
    result in the xDS cache not being updated. By not updating the cache, Envoy will continue using the previous snapshot,
    which we assume to be valid. The problem with this approach is that endpoints are relatively ephemeral entities (think
    Kubernetes pods) and the snapshot that Gloo is using might become stale if any endpoint changes.
    With this fix Gloo will try to update the EDS information in the xDS cache even if an error occurred during translation.
    It does so by retrieving the previous xDS snapshot, updating only the EDS information, verifying the consistency of the
    resulting snapshot, and, if consistent, persisting it in the cache.
