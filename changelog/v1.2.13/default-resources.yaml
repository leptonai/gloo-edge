changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Settings and Gateway resources currently get automatically created when the `gloo` and `gateway` pods
      (respectively) start up. This creates a race condition with our installation that we currently solve by
      creating our default Settings and Gateways as Helm Hook resources, which means that they are not
      managed as a part of the Helm release lifecycle. This is fixed by no longer creating those resources
      if they do not exist when the pods start up.
