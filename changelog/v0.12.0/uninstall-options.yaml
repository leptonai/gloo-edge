changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: |
      `glooctl uninstall` by default only deletes gloo services, deployments, and config maps. It no longer removes the
      installation namespace by default. Several additional options are available: `--delete-crds` will also remove
      gloo custom resource definitions, and any associated objects (virtual services, etc). `--delete-namespace` will
      remove the namespace and anything inside it. `--all` will delete the namespace, CRDs, and any gloo cluster
      roles or cluster role bindings.
