changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Make Gloo fully compatible with go.mod, so that it can be run outside of the GOPATH. As a result of this all of
    the proto import paths needed to be stripped of the `github.com/solo-io` prefix, as that is no longer assured
    outside of the GOPATH.
