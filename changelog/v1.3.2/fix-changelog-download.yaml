      Fix changelog download on LTS support branches. Gloo's release cycle keeps the major and minor versions of open-
      source and closed-source in sync. Gloo needs to generate changelogs for patch releases using older versions of
      the Gloo Enterprise changelog. This PR adds logic to cap the maximum version of Gloo Enterprise used in
      changelog generation, which gets pushed into our docs images.
