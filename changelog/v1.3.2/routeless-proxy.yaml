changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
      Introduce a feature flag in the Settings CRD named disableProxyGarbageCollection,
      located under the 'gloo' options. Set this option to determine the state of
      the envoy configuration when a virtual service is deleted, resulting in a
      proxy with no configured routes.
      Set to true if you wish to keep envoy serving the routes from the latest valid configuration.
      Set to false if you wish to reset the envoy configuration to a clean slate with no routes.
      disableProxyGarbageCollection defaults to 'false'.
