    description: >
      Previously, virtual service validation treated a virtual host with a domain of `""` (empty string)
      as having a domain of `"*"`. This then had the potential to conflict with virtual services that
      legitimately have a domain of `"*"`. Now we report an error from virtual service validation
      when a domain is the empty string.
