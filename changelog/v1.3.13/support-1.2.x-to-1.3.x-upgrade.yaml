    description: >
      Fix upgrade from Gloo 1.2.22+ to 1.3.x. The `alwaysSortRouteTableRoutes` setting was added to the Gloo
      `Settings` API in the 1.2.x stable branch to fix a regression from desired behavior, while enabling users that
      depended on the wrong behavior to enable it. This PR adds and ignores `alwaysSortRouteTableRoutes` to Gloo 1.3.x
      so upgrades from Gloo 1.2.x settings can be parsed by Gloo 1.3.x.
