    description: >
      Add `virtual_service_namespaces` configuration to the `HttpGateway`, which allows `HttpGateway`s to reference
      `VirtualService`s outside of their own namespace using the label selector. The default behavior, which remains
      unchanged, is to restrict gateways to referencing virtual services in their own namespace.
