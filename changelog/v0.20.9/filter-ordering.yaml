changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Allow running the rate limit filter before the auth filters. *NOTE* that, when this new setting is used,
      it will result in the loss of the extauth-aware rate limiting feature (ie, different rate limits for
      authenticated vs unauthenticated users)
