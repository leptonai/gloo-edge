changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
    The Helm chart contained a `Role`/`ClusterRole` named `kube-crd-creator` which was unused. This role caused
    problems to users with limited privileges and effectively prevented them from installing Gloo in namespace-scoped mode.
    This fix removes the `kube-crd-creator` resource from the Helm chart.
