changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    In order to enable routing directly to Kubernetes services (by using `KubernetesServiceDestinations`), Gloo currently
    scans the cluster for services and creates a special type of in-memory Upstream (via the `HybridUpstreamClient`).
    If the cluster contains a lot of services and the user does not take advantage of this feature, this results in
    unnecessary overhead. This change adds a new `disable_kubernetes_destinations` attribute to the `Settings` resource
    to allow disabling the feature.
