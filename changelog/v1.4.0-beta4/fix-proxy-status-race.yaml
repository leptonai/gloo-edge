  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Fix race condition with proxy status and proxy status propagation (e.g., virtual service status) when multiple
      resources are applied at the same time by copying over the previous proxy status (rather than marking as pending
      for re-processing) when it changes from the gateway's point of view but hashes to the same thing (i.e., unchanged
      from gloo's point of view).
