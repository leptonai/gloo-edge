    description: >
      Some users saw commands such as glooctl check or glooctl proxy dump fail due to
      harsh timeout restrictions on the port-forward glooctl does under the covers.
      This results in "Connection Refused" errors that could have been avoided.
      This PR updates the port forward timeouts from 3 to 30 seconds to allow these
      commands more time to finish.
