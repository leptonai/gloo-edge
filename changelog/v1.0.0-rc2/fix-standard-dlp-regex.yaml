    description: >
      Update docs as part of fix to standard DLP SSN and credit card regexes to ignore boundary characters during regex
      match. This fixes potential issues where DLP masks characters outside the interesting part of the match, for
      example, the opening quote if the SSN/Credit Card is part of a JSON response. Before this fix, DLP would
      incorrectly transform this response into invalid JSON by masking the opening parenthesis.
