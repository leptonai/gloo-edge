- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    This change adds new features to the transformation API. It is now possible to define `Extractor`s which target the request/response body
    and use the resulting data in templates. You can decide whether to parse the body as JSON or as raw text; in the
    latter case extraction happens via regular expressions, in the former you will also be able to use all the templating
    capabilities. These have been augmented with three new template functions: `body()` will return the whole request body,
    `context()` will return the base JSON context (allowing for example to `range` on a JSON body that is an array), and
    `env(NAME)` will return the value of an environment variable with the given name. Finally, it is now possible to set
    [Dynamic Metadata](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/advanced/well_known_dynamic_metadata)
    using all the available extraction and templating features. You can now use this metadata to include any request/response
    property you like in the access logs (see the `DYNAMIC_METADATA` command operator
    [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/observability/access_log#command-operators)).
