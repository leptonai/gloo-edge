  - type: HELM
    description: >
      At install time, set an installation ID on all resources. This ID is determined by using the value
      of the new Helm setting "installConfig.installationId", or selecting an ID at random if that
      setting is not provided. If providing your own installation ID, the value you provide must be
      a valid kubernetes label (refer to
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set).
