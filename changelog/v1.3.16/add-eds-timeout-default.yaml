    description: >
      Change the how Gloo handles an unset endpoint warming timeout to make upgrades safer by default. Previously, by
      default Gloo wouldn't wait for endpoints to warm before propagating config to Envoy. With this change, Gloo will
      wait up to five minutes (configurable) for discovery and EDS to warm before propagating config to Envoy, and panic
      if this doesn't happen within the warming timeout. This helps prevent unnecessary downtime in upgrade scenarios.
      If `EndpointsWarmingTimeout` is set to zero on the Gloo settings, the old default behavior is used (Gloo doesn't
      wait for EDS or discovery to be ready before propagating config).
