    description: >
      Propagate all warnings and errors from delegate route tables to the top level Virtual Service status field.
      For example, if we have a long chain of delegated route tables like vs1 -> rt1 -> rt2 -> rt3, and rt3 has
      a warning, that warning will show up on the parent route table rt2 and the top level Virtual Service vs1,
      but not any intermediary route tables like rt1.
