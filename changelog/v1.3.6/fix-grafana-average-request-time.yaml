changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Fixes listener config sent to envoy to be idempotent, so that config no longer reloads as "different" when there are no changes.
      This resolves the issue of the "Average Request Time" graph in grafana showing gaps in the downstream data, among other potential issues.
