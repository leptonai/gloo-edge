    description: >
      Ensure Knative Services are exposed on the internal Knative proxy. currently this assumption is made but not documented
      by Knative's visibility setting: [knative/serving#6642](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/6642). In order for Knative Eventing to work with Gloo,
       Gloo must load cluster-local services on the internal proxy as well.
