    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1893
    description: >
      glooctl assumed a kube-based environment when checking for a client/Server version
      mismtach. When using Consul, this caused a delay in the glooctl command while the connection
      to kubernetes timed out and a kubernetes error message. The version check for non-kubernetes
      environments is now disabled.
