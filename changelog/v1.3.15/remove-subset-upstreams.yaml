    description: >
      Shrink the footprint of discovery significantly by removing upstream creation based on pod labels, which was
      originally used for (and no longer needed by) subset routing. This can drastically reduce the number of upstreams
      created, which in turn will reduce the size of upstreams stored in Gloo in-memory, reducing Gloo's memory
      footprint.
