  - type: FIX
    description: >
      With `disableProxyCollection: false` (the default), extauth had a race condition
      where it could recevie nil config. This could result in 403s that shouldn't happen.
      This change pulls in a fix from solo-kit where GetStatusKeys was returning a slice with
      an empty string, which caused an empty snapshot to be added with an empty version. Fixing
      this issue means that this nil config should no longer occur.
